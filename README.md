This project was completed to provide an investor with insights into the available properties in Girona, Spain for a rental income property. The data was obtained from the Airbnb website and consists of listings of properties in Girona, including the neighborhood, property type, and price.
Data Cleaning and Processing

The raw data was first cleaned and processed in Microsoft Excel to remove any irrelevant or missing data, such as duplicate listings, incomplete information, and outliers. 

Data Visualization

After cleaning and processing the data in Excel, it was then imported into Tableau for visualization. The objective of the project was to create a dashboard that would provide insights into the properties available in Girona for a rental income property. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs, including:

    Average Price by Neighborhood: This chart shows the average price of listings in each neighborhood in Girona, allowing investors to identify which neighborhoods have higher rental rates and may be more profitable for rental income properties.

    Type of Listing: This chart shows the distribution of property types available in Girona, including apartments, houses, and private rooms, helping investors to identify which types of properties are more common and may have higher demand.

    Neighborhood with the Most Listings: This chart shows the number of listings in each neighborhood in Girona, helping investors to identify which neighborhoods have the most properties available for rental income.

    Map: The map visualizes the properties in Girona by price, with an option to filter by the number of bedrooms and property type. This allows investors to identify properties in specific neighborhoods and price ranges.
